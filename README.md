## Features
Points of Interest:
- HillSphere
- Sphere of Influence
- Atmosphere
- Min Orbit
- Max Altitude (Ability to Hide Max Altitude on Atmospheric Bodies)

## Known Issues
See https://github.com/StrikeForceZero/KSP-OrbitPOInts/labels/bug for known issues.

## Planned/TODO/PRs Welcome!
- [x] [~~Submit to CKAN!~~](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/NetKAN/blob/master/NetKAN/OrbitPOInts.netkan)
- [x] ~~Custom colors~~
- [x] ~~Custom POIs ("I want to visualize a 500km ring around a body")~~
   - [x] ~~Allow any number of custom POIs~~
- [ ] Rewrite the mess OrbitPoiVisualizer has become.
- [ ] Cleanup the Settings code and move off some responsibility
- [ ] Cleanup the UI code
- [ ] High resolution max altitude detection for current orbit to warn user if they are at risk of impact
- [ ] Show POI for High/Low Orbit and potentially other science related altitudes
- [x] ~~Persistent Settings~~
- [ ] Custom LineWidths, sphere resolutions
- [ ] Maybe custom inclinations for custom POIs. (e.g. if you wanted to show a polar orbit at 500km)
- [ ] Maybe custom orbit shapes
